    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: Monday, 11th November 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how DF Digital Services Ltd, trading as NachoPR.com ("we", "us", "our"), collects, uses, and protects information when you use our website and services. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in an open and transparent manner.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect and process the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Business contact information</li>
        <li>IP addresses and device information</li>
        <li>Usage data and analytics</li>
        <li>Cookies and tracking information</li>
        <li>Geographic location data</li>
        <li>Professional and business-related information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>We process information under multiple legal bases under GDPR:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Article 6(1)(f) - processing is based on our legitimate business interests</li>
        <li>Article 6(1)(b) - processing is necessary for the performance of a contract or business relationship, as journalists and media professionals are either:
            <ul>
                <li>Independent businesses (sole traders/freelancers)</li>
                <li>Representatives of media corporations acting in a professional capacity</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Article 6(1)(e) - processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, specifically:
            <ul>
                <li>Promoting transparency in journalism and media relations</li>
                <li>Supporting public access to information about media professionals and their affiliations</li>
                <li>Facilitating accurate attribution and verification of journalistic sources</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore, the information we process is classified as business data rather than personal data under GDPR Article 4(1), and our processing serves both legitimate business interests and the public interest in journalistic transparency.</p>

    <p>We retain business information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or as required by law.</p>

    <h2>9. Journalist Information Removal Requests</h2>
